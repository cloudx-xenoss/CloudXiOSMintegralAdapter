## üß∞ Project Configuration / Troubleshooting

**1. Linker Flags**  
Add the following to your project‚Äôs Other Linker Flags in Build Settings:  
`-ObjC`

**2. Enable Objective-C Exceptions (Recommended)**
- Some older versions of Mintegral SDKs expect Obj-C exceptions to be enabled.
- Go to Build Settings
- Set Enable Objective-C Exceptions (GCC_ENABLE_OBJC_EXCEPTIONS) to YES


**3. App Transport Security (ATS)**  
If your app communicates with non-HTTPS servers for ads (less common), update your Info.plist to allow exceptions:  
```
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```
‚ö†Ô∏è *Note: Only do this if absolutely necessary.*


**4. NSUserTrackingUsageDescription (iOS 14+)**  
If your app targets iOS 14+, and you want access to the IDFA, you must add a usage description in your Info.plist:
```
<key>NSUserTrackingUsageDescription</key>
<string>This identifier will be used to deliver personalized ads to you.</string>
```

**5. Privacy Keys (Info.plist)**
Starting iOS 14+, Apple's privacy requirements mean you need to add usage descriptions:
```
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app uses your location for better ad targeting.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app uses your location for better ad targeting.</string>
<key>NSUserTrackingUsageDescription</key>
<string>This identifier will be used to deliver personalized ads to you.</string>
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Optional, only if your app or the ad SDK uses location.


**6. Minimum Deployment Target**  
üì± As of recent versions, Mintegral SDK requires iOS 11.0+. Set this in your project‚Äôs deployment target.


**7. Bitcode (Optional)**  
üö´ Mintegral SDK does not support Bitcode. If you're running into issues during archive or validation, disable Bitcode:  

Go to your target ‚Üí Build Settings ‚Üí Set **Enable Bitcode** to `NO`.
